# This document will serve as an initial starting point for the goals of this fork, and what we aim to accomplish. We will also discuss here what we do *not* want to do, under any circumstances. #


#  * We *would* like to: #
    * Merge up to, and keep some measure of pace with, the OpenMW Development brach.
    * Improve the ease of use and documentation of the existing scripting API, including more example code, simplified functions, and additional helpers to alleviate boilerplate in tes3mp custom scripts
    * Where possible, improve the performance and safety of tes3mp itself
    * Provide a current and open implementation for the master server
    * Make up a new, unique name that is not person-specific, cheeky, hostile, or derivative of any copyrighted work, including tes3mp itself, and OpenMW.
    * If possible, maintain compatibility with our parent project, tes3mp.
    * Be very explicit that this is a unique fork based on tes3mp. There should not at any point be alterations to the git history or any repository's contents which make the origin of this code ambiguous, or otherwise remove attribution from any of tes3mp's contributors, or those of the MWMADNESS GitHub team.
    *

# * Things we would definitely *not* like to do at any point, ever: #
  * Engage publicly in any behavior which is outwardly hostile toward the original project
  * Intentionally break compatibility with either upstream project
  * Integrate a mechanism through which the server would provide plugin or asset data to clients.
    This has been discussed, and sounds nice, but isn't safe or realistic to implement. 
    We encourage interested admins to provide their own lauchers or, preferably, make Wabbajack lists. *currentyearargument*
